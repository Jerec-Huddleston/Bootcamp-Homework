    - `-H`

13. Which `curl` option is used to view the response header?
    - `--head`

14. Which request method might an attacker use to figure out which HTTP requests an HTTP server will accept?
    - OPTIONS

#### Sessions and Cookies

Recall that HTTP servers need to be able to recognize clients from one another. They do this through sessions and cookies.

Answer the following questions about sessions and cookies:

15. Which response header sends a cookie to the client?

    ```HTTP
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: text/html
    Set-Cookie: cart=Bob
    ```
    - Set-Cookie: cart=Bob

16. Which request header will continue the client's session?

    ```HTTP
    GET /cart HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    Cookie: cart=Bob
    ```
    - Cookie: cart=Bob
